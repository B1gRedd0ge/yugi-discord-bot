# yuhgio-Bot

Current features
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As of 03/14/2019:
  -The bot sends the user a random card image with the command $card and logs the cards cardID to the users userID in a database /n
  -Users can request a list of all of their currently owned cards with the command $myinventory, however it sends the card ID
   instead of the card name and sends a new message for every item, this is currently top of the TODO list along with a way to
   send the image of owned cards to the channel at a users request.
